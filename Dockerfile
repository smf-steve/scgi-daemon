# For now, we use a 'docker cp' command on the CLI to place
#   the cgi-program into the docker container
# In the future, we should either:
#  - use a docker build arg to pass in the name of the file. 
#    But this has be done via a URL:  
#      ADD  ${PROGRAM}		       /scgi-daemon/cgi-program
#  - use a MULTI-stage build to bring not only the program but also all of its stuff.
# Perhaps the multi-stage build is not used here, but in the final build process.
